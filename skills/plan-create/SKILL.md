# Create Implementation Plan

## Primary Directive

Your goal is to create a new implementation plan. Your output must be machine-readable, deterministic, and structured for autonomous execution by other AI agents or humans.

The plan purpose comes from the Paperclip issue context — the issue title, description, and any parent issue's `plan` document provide the scope and requirements.

## Execution Context

This prompt is designed for AI-to-AI communication and automated processing. All instructions must be interpreted literally and executed systematically without human interpretation or clarification.

## Core Requirements

- Generate implementation plans that are fully executable by AI agents or humans
- Use deterministic language with zero ambiguity
- Structure all content for automated parsing and execution
- Ensure complete self-containment with no external dependencies for understanding

## Plan Structure Requirements

Plans must consist of discrete, atomic phases containing executable tasks. Each phase must be independently processable by AI agents or humans without cross-phase dependencies unless explicitly declared.

## Phase Architecture

- Each phase must have measurable completion criteria
- Tasks within phases must be executable in parallel unless dependencies are specified
- All task descriptions must include specific file paths, function names, and exact implementation details
- No task should require human interpretation or decision-making

## AI-Optimized Implementation Standards

- Use explicit, unambiguous language with zero interpretation required
- Structure all content as machine-parseable formats (tables, lists, structured data)
- Include specific file paths, line numbers, and exact code references where applicable
- Define all variables, constants, and configuration values explicitly
- Provide complete context within each task description
- Use standardized prefixes for all identifiers (REQ-, TASK-, etc.)
- Include validation criteria that can be automatically verified

## Plan Storage

Plans are stored as Paperclip issue documents using the `plan` document key:

- **Create**: `PUT /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/plan` with `{ "title": "Plan", "format": "markdown", "body": "<plan content>" }`
- **Read**: `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/plan`
- **Update**: `PUT /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/plan` with `{ "title": "Plan", "format": "markdown", "body": "<updated content>", "baseRevisionId": "<revision from GET>" }`

If a plan document already exists, fetch it first and include its `baseRevisionId` when updating. Decide whether the current request is a new task (overwrite) or a continuation (revise).

## Mapping Plans to Paperclip Issues

The plan's phase and task structure maps directly to Paperclip subtask issues:

- Each **Implementation Phase** can become a subtask issue with `parentId` linking to the parent plan issue
- Each **TASK-** row becomes a description for an individual subtask issue
- Dependencies between phases map to `blockedByIssueIds`
- Use the `paperclip-converting-plans-to-tasks` skill for detailed guidance on decomposing plans into executable issues
- Include the issue document link `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#document-plan` when referencing the plan from comments or subtask descriptions

## Mandatory Template Structure

All implementation plans must strictly adhere to the following template. Each section is required and must be populated with specific, actionable content. AI agents must validate template compliance before execution.

## Template Validation Rules

- All front matter fields must be present and properly formatted
- All section headers must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- All identifier prefixes must follow the specified format
- Tables must include all required columns
- No placeholder text may remain in the final output

## Status

The status of the implementation plan must be clearly defined in the front matter and must reflect the current state of the plan. The status can be one of the following (status_color in brackets): `Completed` (bright green badge), `In progress` (yellow badge), `Planned` (blue badge), `Deprecated` (red badge), or `On Hold` (orange badge). It should also be displayed as a badge in the introduction section.

## Human Review

After writing the plan to the issue `plan` document, open a `request_confirmation` interaction tied to the latest plan revision and set the issue to `in_review`. This creates a formal approval gate — do not proceed to creating subtask issues until confirmation is received.
